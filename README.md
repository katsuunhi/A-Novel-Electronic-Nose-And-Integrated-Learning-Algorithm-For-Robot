**ABSTRACT:**Realizing smell perception in mobile robot is a challenging task.Usually, electronic nose is composed of a large number of sensors, which can sense the smell of objects through free diffusion. It cannot meet the requirements of small size, low cost and quick response that robots pursue.In order to address the issue, a new active electronic nose is designed and the integrated learning algorithm (AGSG) is trained on the TX2 platform.The active electronic nose consists of an array of three semiconductor gas sensors (MQ303) and an electrochemical sensor (DART-2-FE5).The microprocessor STM32334 controls the air duct to capture the scent and send the transformed information to the TX2 platform, sensing it in just three seconds. the accuracy of the regression model SXL(SVM, XGBoost and Lightgbm integrated learning algorithm) reached 99%, the accuracy of the classification model SGGD(SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayesian, Gaussian Process, and Decision Tree integrated learning algorithm) reached 96%, and in the training of AGSG (Active Gaussian Process, SVM and Gaussian Naive Bayesian integrated learning algorithm), which only has 30% of the data participated also reached more than 90% accuracy. The combination of active electronic nose and integrated learning algorithm can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of odor data collection and provide a new idea for robot to learn more odors.<br>
